<h1 align="center">Brightness Controller</h1>

> Simple App to control monitor's brightness on a desktop, when there is no GNOME option.

## Motivation

I started using more and more Linux Ubuntu and having the problem of controlling the brightness of my monitors with a simple UI app made me start this project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3

## Usage

For now, it is just a CLI. Really simple, choose your monitor with an `int` number and then choose the the brightness between `0` and `1`.
